# Database Configuration
# To connect your own database, create a file named application-local.properties,
# provide your database details there. In ProjectflowApplication, you can change the profile to "local"
# to use the configurations from application-local.properties. Be cautious not to commit sensitive data to GitHub.
# It is recommended to use separate files like application-[profile].properties and the "local" profile for enhanced security.
# You can also change profiles through the "Run/Debug Configuration" in your IDE.
